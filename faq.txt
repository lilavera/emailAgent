Question: What is an AI agent?
Answer: An AI agent is a software program that can perform tasks autonomously using artificial intelligence. It can understand user input, make decisions, and carry out actions based on defined logic or goals.

Question: How can I integrate an AI agent with my existing system?
Answer: You can integrate an AI agent using APIs or SDKs provided by your AI platform. Most platforms support integration with web apps, CRMs, helpdesks, and other business tools.

Question: What models do your agents use?
Answer: Our agents are powered by OpenAI's GPT models, including GPT-4 and GPT-4o, depending on the selected configuration.

Question: Can I fine-tune the agent’s behavior?
Answer: Yes. You can fine-tune prompts, provide custom tools (functions), or even connect your agent to your own knowledge base using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

Question: Is my data secure with the AI agent?
Answer: Yes. We use industry-standard encryption and do not store user data unless explicitly enabled. You maintain control over what data is shared with the model.

Question: How do I debug agent responses?
Answer: Use logging to track messages, tool calls, and agent decisions. You can also test with mock inputs to simulate user interactions and evaluate the agent's reasoning.

Question: Can the agent process emails or tickets automatically?
Answer: Yes. The agent can read, categorize, draft, and even send replies to emails or tickets, depending on the permissions and tools you've connected.

Question: How do I limit the agent from making certain decisions?
Answer: You can implement conditional routing, restrict tool access, or use guardrails within your prompt structure to prevent undesired actions.

Question: What happens if the agent doesn’t know the answer?
Answer: If configured properly, the agent can either escalate the query to a human operator or reply with a fallback message indicating that it needs more information.

Question: Does the agent support multiple languages?
Answer: Yes. GPT-based agents support multilingual input and output. You can also customize prompts for specific language preferences or locales.
